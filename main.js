  ---- Understanding the problem ----
  - The game will be played against the computer. 
  - The computer will randomly choose between 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
  - The player will input their choice.
  - The game will compare both choices and determine the winner based on the rules:
    - Rock beats Scissors
    - Scissors beats Paper
    - Paper beats Rock
    - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
  - The game will keep track of both the player’s score and the computer’s score.
	- The game will be played round by round, and the winner of each round will 
  - have their score incremented.
	- Each round’s result will be displayed with a winner announcement.
